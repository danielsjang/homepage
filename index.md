I am a graduate student at MIT's ARClab advised by Professor Richard Linares.  My research focuses on the field of reinforcement learning and robotics. Specifically, I am interested in meta-learning for enabling a robot to adapt fast to unseen situations, hierarchical learning for solving the delayed credit assignments, and multi-agent reinforcement learning for learning to coordinate with other simultaneously learning robots.

Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (summa cum laude) at Cornell.
